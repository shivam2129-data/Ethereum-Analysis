# Ethereum-Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyse Ethereum transactions and smart contracts using Big Data Processing techniques.
The analysis covers the full set of transactions that took place on the network from August 2015 to January 2019. 
The project uses a dataset containing information about blocks, transactions, and contracts on the Ethereum network, as well as a dataset of known scams on the network. 
The blocks dataset includes information such as block number, hash, nonce, gas limit, and transaction count. 
The transactions dataset includes information such as transaction hash, sender and receiver addresses, gas price, and value transferred. 
The contracts dataset includes information about contract addresses, bytecode, and function signature hashes. The scams dataset includes information about reported scams, including their name, hosting URL, associated addresses, and status.
The project requires the creation of several Spark programs to perform various
computations on the dataset.
